      Designed to hold Samsung Galaxy Centura phones perpendicular to the table, these holders are both artistic and functional
    </p>
    <p>
      Key components -- the USB connector and camera -- are unimpeded by the design of the holder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Print time is 90 minutes.

      Key features:
      <ul>
        <li>The arcs at the top are shallow enough to print without overhangs and to trace around the micro USB power input.</li>
        <li>The crossbars in the middle hold the halfs together, while also resting the phone at the same height as the base layer.</li>
        <li>All arcs are filled-in on the outside, to more easily print the holder.</li>
      </ul>
