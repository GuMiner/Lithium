<h2>Conceptual Design</h2>
<p>
  This project was initially to create a low-cost, custom electronics board capable of driving six stepper motors. Because my mill design was unusual in requiring six stepper motors, currently-available boards such as the <a href="https://ultimachine.com/collections/hardware">RAMPS board</a> and <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Electronics">other electronics</a> were not be capable of driving my mill.
</p>
<p>
  To construct the electronics board, I prototyped a PCB with <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">KiCad</a> and send the design out for manufacturing to <a href="https://oshpark.com/">OSH Park</a>. Because OSH Park charges for the total rectangular surface area used, I attempted to collapse a 12-pin keypad, a 128x64 LCD display, six stepper motor drives and an <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATMEGA328P">ATmega328P-PU microcontroller</a> all on the single board. To support all of these devices, I also used a few <a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/302/74HC_HCT595-225040.pdf">serial-to-parallel</a> chips to increase the total number of I/O pins available.
</p>
<b>Pins required:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Six <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/1182">stepper motor drivers</a>: 1 (reset) + 6*2 (direction + step) = 13 (output)</li>
  <li>Drill Bit PWM: 1 (speed selection) = 1 (output)</li>
  <li>Drill Bit PWM speed indicator: 1 (actual drill bit speed) =  1 (input)</li>
  <li>12-button keypad: 1 (current button press value) =  1 (analog input)</li>
  <li>General-purpose potentiometer: 1 (current dial value) =  1 (analog input)</li>
  <li>Computer input line: 1 (data input) = 1 (input)</li>
  <li>128x64 display: 8 (data lines) + 2 (chip selection) + 3 (reset / clock / command (or) data) = 13 (output)</li>
  <li>Status LEDs: 2</li>
  <li><b>Total:</b> 33</li>
</ul>
Finally, to complete the design I ensured that:
<ul>
  <li>Each stepper motor driver has two headers -- one to swap out the motor, the other to swap out the driver.</li>
  <li>Each stepper motor driver has it's own transient protection capacitor on the 12 V line.</li>
  <li>The ATmega has additional passive components to reduce the noise on the analog reference 5 V line.</li>
  <li>The keypad uses a resistor network to uniquely identify each key (which creates a short on two of its pins), to significantly reduce the pin count to 1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>
  I went through two main phases testing these boards -- mechanical and electrical -- to verify the operation of the device.
</p>

<h3> Mechanical Design Errors</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Major:</b> The stepper-motor sockets were all 1-pin spaced too far apart (oops). Pins fit when bent.</li>
  <li><i>Minor:</i> The capacitor pads were too small, so all the capacitors were placed sideways.</li>
  <li><i>Minor:</i> The LCD covers the backlight pads -- which was OK, because I wasn't planning on using the backlight.</li>
  <li><i>Minor:</i> I used the wrong sized-pads for the keypad, so it only accepts smaller pin sizes -- such as the pin sizes the keypad happened to have.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Electrical Design Errors</h3>
<p>
  Although the mill was functional, the ATmega328 microcontroller had a hard time running the whole operation at a reasonable rate.
</p>
