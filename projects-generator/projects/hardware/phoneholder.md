Key features:
-> The arcs at the top are shallow enough to print without overhangs and to trace around the micro USB power input.
- The crossbars in the middle hold the halfs together, while also resting the phone at the same height as the base layer.
-< All arcs are filled-in on the outside, to more easily print the holder.
