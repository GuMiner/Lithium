    {} How to make your own Geiger counter:
    -> Purchase a kit from <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/diygeigercounter/home">DIYGeigerCounter</a>
    - Purchase a geiger counter tube from <a href="http://www.goldmine-elec-products.com/">Electronic Goldmine</a>
    - Assemble the electronics
    - Put it in a case, such as mine on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:191113">Thingiverse</a> or your own
    -< Test it with a uranium-glazed pottery piece from <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>

{} This case stores 6-AA's, the main electronics, the geiger-counter tube (as a snap-on component), and various interactive components, such as the power switch (left side) and brightness control (right side).

## Case Design
{} This was one of the first useful projects I designed and printed with my 3D printer. As such, the design was partly squished because I had to fit the entire case design within the build plate of my 3D printer.
{} This design is also quite dated, but is still functional.

{}  These models were designed using <a href="http://brlcad.org/">BRL-CAD</a>, which gave me a scripting interface to create the models along with a graphical output view. With this design:
-> The geiger counter base separates the battery storage from the electronics compartment
- The geiger counter lid u-pipe holds the geiger counter tube as a snap-in item
-< The geiger counter tube holder has several holes, permitting charged particles to pass through
{} There are certainly several enhancements I'd make if I were recreating this design (or printing it in bulk), but overall the entire design worked as expected.
