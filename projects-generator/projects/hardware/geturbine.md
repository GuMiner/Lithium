## About
[g
 [
 {} Available from <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:392115">Thingiverse</a>, this print was a mechanical parts test.
 {} While this model required a significant amount of time (and sanding), the turbine is able to freely spin on the two bearings attached to the frame.

## Challenges
[g
[
 {} With the poor printing tolerances in my inexpensive 3D printer, each gear needed sanding for proper alignment. Each gear nicely aligned with each other once sanding was complete.
 {} In addition to that difficulty, the slicer software would generate extreme vibration about halfway through the print, as it attempted to trace out imperceptively thin vanes of the main fan.
 {}The fix for that issue was to send the model into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6">3D Builder</a> and reduce the model quality such that the 3d printer wouldn't attempt to print those excessive fine details.
