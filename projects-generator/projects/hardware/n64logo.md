@hardware-projects/printing/n64-logo/n64_innards.jpg~The broken leg of the N64 logo.
[
{} This print was performed with 5% infill, and with a very thin wall, leaving an extremely hollow interior.
{} Unfortunately, this infill ratio was insufficient. As a result, one of the legs partially broke, revealing the interior structure.
