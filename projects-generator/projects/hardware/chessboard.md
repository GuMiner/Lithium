{} With access to either an <a href="https://www.epiloglaser.com/laser-machines/product-line/">Epilog Helix</a> or a <a href="http://www.ulsinc.com/products/">Universal</a> laser, you can make your own chess board.

This chess board was created within 10 minutes using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visio">Visio</a>,
and engraved in 30 minutes on the Universal laser.
<br /><br/>
Normally the translucent (engraved) squares would be completely opaque,
but by using a reduced engraving power I instead engraved marbled squares.
<br /><br/>
With 3"-scale chess pieces from the
<a href="http://www.unclesgames.com/">local game store</a>,
the chess set was made complete.
