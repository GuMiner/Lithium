{} If you'll want to download these models for yourself, be prepared for some complications!
-> First, you'll need to use the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a> to acquire the files.
-< After that, <a href="http://brlcad.org/%22">BRL-CAD</a> is one of the few programs that can properly convert the unusual 3D model structure into <i>.STL</i> files for import into Autodesk 123D Make.
