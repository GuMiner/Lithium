{} Using Autodesk 123D Make (alternate download <a href="https://autodesk-123d-make.en.lo4d.com/windows">link</a>), I converted the Class 1 & Class 2 drones from the <a href="https://www.interplay.com/">Descent</a> video game to physical models.

{} If you'll want to download these models for yourself, be prepared for some complications!
-> First, you'll need to use the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive Wayback Machine</a> to acquire the files.
-< After that, <a href="https://brlcad.org">BRL-CAD</a> is one of the few programs that can properly convert the unusual 3D model structure into <i>.STL</i> files for import into Autodesk 123D Make.
