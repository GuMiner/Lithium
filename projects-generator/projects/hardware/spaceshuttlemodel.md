  {} While experimenting with Autodesk 123D Make (alternate download <a href="https://autodesk-123d-make.en.lo4d.com/windows">link</a>), I discovered simple support for slicing models to generate laser-cut plans. This functionality makes it really, really easy to take a 3D model and generate plans for a physical realization of those plans.
  {} With this program, I converted the <a href="http://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/sts">Space Shuttle Model</a> from <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> to a series of plans, which I then laser-cut.
