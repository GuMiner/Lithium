{} I spent some time in <a href="http://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software">Visio</a> to generate a wave generator board from wooden scrap material. This let me  experiment with the Microsoft Garage's <a href="https://www.epiloglaser.com/laser-machines/product-line/">Epilog Helix</a> laser cutter.

 {} This board was designed to recreate the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/standw.html">standing wave</a> experiment with a linear actuator being driven with a <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ug/discrete-fourier-transform.html">Fourier Transform</a>-generated waveform.
