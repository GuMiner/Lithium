## About
The <b>{{ project.name }}</b> project was started to answer a number of questions:
-> What is the difference between modern OpenGL and DirectX?
- Can I make a time-dependend electromagnetic simulation?
-< How is a full-screen Windows Modern (Metro) Application different from a desktop OpenGL / DirectX application?
}

## Mathematics
To test these technologies, I decided to simulate point particles.
<br />
With my previous simulator, I had used <i>Lorentz's Force Law</i> in combination with <i>Newton's Second
Law</i> to simulate particle motion, and roughly approximate the electric and magnetic fields from the
particle positions and velocities.
%\vec{F}=q(\vec{E} + \vec{v}\times\vec{B})~Lorentz Force Law for a point charge in an electric and a magnetic field
%\vec{F}=m\vec{a}~Newton's Second Law
%\vec{E(r)}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum\limits_{i}\frac{q_i}{R^2}\hat{R}~The steady-state electric field at \(r\) given \(\vec{R}\) <small>(the vector from a point charge to your point \(r\))</small> summed over all particles.
%\vec{B(r)}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\sum\limits_{i}\frac{q_i\vec{v_i}\times\hat{R_i}}{R_i^2}~The steady-state magnetic field at \(r\) given \(\vec{R}\), summed over all particles.
}

However, these approximates above don't account for the time that it takes for changes in a particle's position to be visible to other particles, because information only travels at the speed of light. These approximate equations above are only correct for non-relativistic, steady-state situations.
}
{
For this simulation, I used a (less approximate) equation from my E&M course and stored the history of each particle's motion so that time effects could be properly considered. By setting \(\vec{u}=c\hat{R}-\vec{v}\), the following equations were used:
}
%\vec{E(r,t)}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum\limits_{i}\frac{q_iR_i}{(\vec{R_i}\cdot\vec{u_i})^3}((c^2-v_i^2)\vec{u_i}+\vec{R_i}\times(\vec{u_i}\times\vec{a_i}))~An updated electric field equation, but where the vector \(\vec{R}\) accounts for when the particle was given a light speed delay
%\vec{B(r,t)}=\frac{1}{c}\hat{R}\times\vec{E(r,t)})~An updated magnetic field equation, calculated using the updated electric field equation
{
I didn't add the <i>Abraham-Lorentz</i> force to these equations because the particles spontaneously accelerates when done so, with that level of detail also beyond my level of understanding.
}

In terms of the simulation, this screenshot also shows the electromagnetic waves being propagated over time, as expected.

Surprisingly, I found programming in modern DirectX to be extremely similar to programming in modern OpenGL.
In both cases, you:
-> Load shaders
- Setup the shader data format
- Load a vertex buffer with triangles
-< Batch render through the shaders
Even the shading languages (HLSL/GLSL) are very much C-like, with minor differences.
Overall, if you know how to do vertex-array-based OpenGL or DirectX programming, you'll be able to
transition into using the other language very, very quickly.
