## About
[g
[
 {} <b>{{ project.name }}</b> was a small mobile application to describe, demonstrate, and visualize algorithms.
 {} At the time, this project was written for the Windows Phone. This software is no longer available now that that store is shut down.

[
 {} The main algorithms included in the demo program were searching and sorting algorithms.
 {} A few miscellaneous physics and math-based algorithms were also added for additional visualization.

## Unique Aspects
{} This phone application is structured so that once a visualization type is defined, it was very easy to create new algorithms that use the same visualization type.
<blockquote>For example, most of the <b>Sorting</b> visualizations feature a bar-graph sort view.</blockquote>
{} I also tried to polish this to be an 'official' phone application, so this application included support for landscape orientation, transition animations, and was partly-localized to additional languages.
