## About
{} <b>{{ project.name }}</b> was a scientific calculator with unit analysis functionality, designed for users heavily using unit analysis.

]
At the time, I had a Windows Phone and wrote this software for that platform.

{} As that platform has been discontinued and the store shut down, this software is no longer available.

As a basic scientific calculator, this application supported:
-> Trigonometric & inverse trigonometric functions
- Multiple base systems
- Logarithmic functions
- Variable storage and retrieval
-< ... etc ...

## Unique Aspects
{} This was my only phone application incorporating advertisements, and was designed to be more useful (and polished) than <b>Numerian</b> (my first Windows Phone application).
{} Surprisingly, incorporating advertisements was the easy part -- but due to the negligible user base, I'll never made any income from this application.
